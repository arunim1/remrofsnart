# Deployment Guide for Streamlit Cloud

## Ready-to-Deploy Apps

Both apps now load the model from HuggingFace and are ready for cloud deployment:

- **`simple_app.py`** - Clean, reliable version (recommended for deployment)
- **`streaming_app.py`** - Real-time streaming version with token prepending

## Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add simple_app.py streaming_app.py requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Add cloud-ready Streamlit apps"
   git push
   ```

2. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Visit https://share.streamlit.io/
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

3. **Deploy the app**:
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository: `remrofsnart`
   - Choose main file: `simple_app.py` or `streaming_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy!"

4. **The app will**:
   - Automatically download the model from HuggingFace
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Be accessible via a public URL

## Model Loading

Both apps now use:
- **Model source**: `https://huggingface.co/arunim1/gpt-2-rev/resolve/main/model.pt`
- **Caching**: `@st.cache_resource` ensures the model downloads only once
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure if download fails

## Recommended for Deployment

Use **`simple_app.py`** for production deployment because:
- ✅ More stable and reliable
- ✅ Faster user experience (no streaming delays)
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Less resource intensive

Use **`streaming_app.py`** for demos where the streaming effect is important:
- ✅ Shows real-time token generation
- ✅ Visual feedback of the reverse generation process
- ⚠️ Slightly more resource intensive

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, your app will:
- Have a public URL like `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app/`
- Automatically handle model downloads
- Work exactly like your local version
- Scale automatically with Streamlit Cloud
