Come, sir; here come, I tell thee,
Here come a word with another,
I cannot speak of you.

LUCIO:
I'll tell what he hath done this,
Even to a foolish fellow, take the house.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, sir, 'tis a thing of him.

LUCIO:
No, go on him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, what of thee, good Lord, all of you!
